    removing degenerate bases in primer, cutting off bases at the end of each
    sequence, only reading sequences of a specified length, and for randomly
    discarding a given proportion of sequences are available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_dir : str
        Filepath to folder which contains subfolders which each have an R1
        fastq file. read_seqs loops through these subfolders to find these
        files.
    filename_end : str (default: 'trimmed.fq')
        Suffix of the fastq filenames to read. Should be the same for every
        condition.
    degen : int (default: 0)
        Number of degenerate bases at the 3' end of the 5' initiator. This
        number of bases will get cut out from the beginning of each sequence.
    cutoff : float (default: 0.0)
        How many bases to cut off at the end of the sequence. Also gets rid of
        sequences that are less than cutoff length. Can be a decimal value, in
        which case, on average that many bases will be cut off. For example,
        if cutoff=2.5, 2 bases will be cut off 50% of the time and 3 bases will
        be cut off 50% of the time. All sequences less than 3 bases long would
        be thrown out. Any sequences of length 0 after this step are thrown
        out as well.
    seq_len_req : int (default: None)
        If provided, only sequences of length seq_len_req will be processed.
        This length is the sequence length after applying degen and cutoff.
    p_discard : float (default: 0.0)
        Randomly discard this proportion of sequences (0 for none, 1 for all).
        Useful for investigating how much data is required for good prediction.
    cond_text : list of str (default: None)
        If given, searches for these strings within each directory name. If
        none are present, ignores that directory completely. Useful for
        only reading sequences for specific conditions.
    exact_cond_text : bool (default: False)
        If True, matches directory name exactly (using cond_text). If false,
        searches within directory name for cond_text. Discards that condition
        if not found.

    Returns
    -------
    seqs : dict
        Key is directory (condition) name, value is a list of further
        processed sequences given input options.
